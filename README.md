## CDK Pipelines Demo

Cloud Development Kit (CDK) Pipelines is a library that makes it easy to deploy CI/CD Pipelines using [AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/).

In this demo you will deploy a pipeline in CodePipeline which is triggered when new commits are pushed to a GitHub repository. The pipeline runs some unit tests and mutates the pipeline if any changes have been made in the git repository. Finally, it builds a container image, uploads it to [AWS Elastic Container Registry](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) and deploys the container to [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).

**PLEASE NOTE:** This sample is intended for proof of concept or demo use cases, and not for production workloads.

#### Prerequisites

To deploy the demo, you will require:

- an AWS account. If you donâ€™t already have an AWS account, create one at <https://aws.amazon.com> by following the on-screen instructions.
- a GitHub account. You can create an account at <https://github.com/>.
- the [AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_install) installed and bootstrapped.
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html) with [credentials configured](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) which will also be used by the CDK. [Administrator Access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/python/aws_cdk.pipelines/README.html#provisioning-the-pipeline) is recommend but this is only for the initial deployment of the pipeline.
- Python 3.6 or newer.

#### Prepare your GitHub repository

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repository to your own GitHub account
2. Create a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) for your repository with the scopes:
   - `repo`
   - `admin:repo_hook`
3. Use AWS Secrets Manager to store the Personal Access Token. Adding the Token to the `secret-string` parameter
   ```
   aws secretsmanager create-secret --name lambda_container_cdk_pipeline_github --description 'OAuth token for Github Repo.' --secret-string '{"github":"YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"}'
   ```
4. Clone the forked repository from your own account

   ```
   git clone YOUR_FORKED_REPOSITORY
   ```

5. In the `pipeline/pipeline_stack.py` file, on line 44, add your GitHub username

6. Commit the change to your repository

   ```
   git add pipeline/pipeline_stack.py
   git commit -m "Added GitHub username to pipeline file."
   git push
   ```

#### Deploy to AWS

1. Create a Python virtual environment and install the required libraries

   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Deploy the pipeline

   ```
   cdk synth
   cdk deploy
   ```

3. Ensure the pipeline completes an initial deployment of the Lambda function. You can confirm this by checking that the newly created pipeline has a status of "Succeeded" in the CodePipeline section of the AWS Console.

### Testing

#### Pushing Code to the Lambda function

To make a change to the code of the Lambda function, edit the `handler.py` file. Append some text to the return value and then push the code to your repository.

This will trigger a release and the change will begin running through the pipeline. Once finished the function can be tested via the console.

  <img src="imgs/test_function.PNG" alt="Testing the function" />
</p>

#### Test a failure on the unit tests

The pipeline has three unit tests to demonstrate the process. These are defined in `unittests/test_lambda_function.py`.

To create a failure, in `pipeline/lambda_stack.py` edit either the `memory_size` or the `timeout` and change them to differ from the initial values of 1024 for `memory_size` and 30 for `timeout`.

Once the code is pushed the pipeline will run again, but this time it will fail at the initial build Stage.

<p align="center">
  <img src="imgs/unittestfail.PNG" alt="Failure on Unittests" />
</p>

Then using the `Tail Log` option you can see the relevant failure output

<p align="center">
  <img src="imgs/unittestfail1.PNG" alt="Failure on Unittests" />
</p>

Restore the pipeline by changing the settings back to the original values.

#### Pipeline Mutation

Pipelines created by CDK Pipelines will self mutate based on your code.

To demonstrate this, in `pipeline/pipeline_stack.py` uncomment lines 82 and 83

```
lambda_function2 = ApplicationStageLambda1(self, 'Container-CDK-Pipeline-Lambda-Stage2')
lambda_function_stage2 = pipeline.add_stage(lambda_function2, pre=[buildContainerProject])
```

This will tell the pipeline to deploy a second Lambda Function using our container image.

Once the changes are pushed to GitHub, the pipeline will run and you will notice the execution restart at the UpdatePipeline step.

<p align="center">
  <img src="imgs/pipeline_mutation.PNG" alt="Pipeline Mutation" />
</p>

This is because the pipeline has determined a mutation is required and will now execute with the second Lambda as part of the deployment.

You should now see your pipeline has changed and a stage to deploy the second Lambda function has been added without any changes made directly to CodePipeline.

<p align="center">
  <img src="imgs/pipeline_mutation_stage_added.PNG" alt="Pipeline Mutation Stage Added" />
</p>

If you now re-comment lines 83 and 84 you will see that the pipeline mutates again and the stage is removed.

### Removing the Pipeline and Other Resources

To full remove the created resources, run the following CLI commands:

```
cdk destroy cdk-pipelines-demo/Container-CDK-Pipeline-Lambda-Stage1/Demo-Lambda1
cdk destroy cdk-pipelines-demo/Container-CDK-Pipeline-Lambda-Stage2/Demo-Lambda2
cdk destroy cdk-pipelines-demo
aws ecr delete-repository --repository-name YOUR_ECR_REPO --force
aws secretsmanager delete-secret --secret-id lambda_container_cdk_pipeline_github --force-delete-without-recovery
```
